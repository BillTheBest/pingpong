[Need to flesh this out]

## privates-moveMe.json file
You will need to move the file in this directory one level up from the Gruntfile.js and rename it to privates.json. This allows you to use private variables.

## configuration files
need to update _config.yml

## humans.txt
use data from _config.yml to update humans.txt

## produrl & devurl
update grunt tasks to use these urls

## GA code
maybe put prod & dev GA code in _config.yml

## create a class for dynamic classes
so that uncss doesn't wipe it out
